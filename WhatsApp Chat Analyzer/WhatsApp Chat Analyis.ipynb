      "Dear Students,\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are facing any attendance-related issues, please follow the proper process:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, meet your coordinator and discuss your concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, approach the faculty members who taught you during the semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your case is genuine, you may request to check the attendance register. All faculty members are committed to cooperating when your concern is authentic and verifiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "⚠️ However, if anyone is trying to make false claims or act clever, please remember — our faculty members are highly experienced and fully aware of such tactics.\n",
      "\n",
      "🏥 For Students with Medical Issues:\n",
      "If you have a genuine medical concern (not fabricated), inform your coordinator, or ask your parents to visit the college. We are always ready to help in honest and documented cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "📌 Why Attendance Matters:\n",
      "This is a private institution, not a government school. The management expects results, not excuses. Success can only be achieved through consistent class attendance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attendance is directly linked to your academic success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor attendance often leads to backlogs, and under AKTU’s strict policies, even year backs are possible. Don’t take it lightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "🎯 Competing in the Real World:\n",
      "You come from varied academic backgrounds — from 50% to 90% in 12th grade, and some even have 3 to 4 active backlogs. Yet, students with only 10% to 40% attendance still expect top-tier placements and training.\n",
      "\n",
      "But remember — you are all now competing in the same job market.\n",
      "\n",
      "At KCC, we are continuously striving to provide:\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Quality lectures\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Skill-building training (HCL, Bootcamp, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Strong placement support\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ A positive and competitive academic atmosphere\n",
      "\n",
      "We even organized coding classes on Saturdays and sent multiple reminders — but hardly anyone attended. This clearly shows that many students are only making excuses instead of taking advantage of real opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "We allow students with low attendance to appear in exams through an attendance affidavit — but this is a privilege, not a right. It is given to deserving and sincere students, not those who misuse the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "💼 Take Responsibility for Your Career:\n",
      "When placements begin, excuses like “Sir, I didn’t get selected because…” will not help — by then, it’s too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ KCC is committed to improving academics, faculty quality, training, and placements — but your success depends on your own effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "We feel proud when our students secure internships and placements in reputed companies. They become the face of the college — not just for their attendance, but for their overall performance and dedication.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔚 Final Words:\n",
      "75% attendance is mandatory under AKTU norms — and this is the bare minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "We support all students fairly, but we cannot fulfil unrealistic expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s time to stop making excuses and focus on:\n",
      "\n",
      "🎯 Your internal marks\n",
      "📈 Your GPA\n",
      "🎓 Your career goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Find a mentor who inspires and guides you forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "KCC continues to offer one of the most affordable and supportive environments in the region — both academically and in hostel facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, a parent came all the way from Bihar, full of expectations — only to discover that their child was irregular, gave false excuses, and even provided a fake parent contact number.\n",
      "\n",
      "❌ This is not acceptable behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are here to support and motivate you, but in the end, you are responsible for your future.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you still have concerns, please meet your coordinator, chief coordinator, or request a parent meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "📚 Study hard — especially in 1st & 2nd year — your GPA matters more than you think.\n",

      "Dear Students,\n",
      "\n",
      "It has come to our notice that several students with low attendance are now coming up with various excuses—some medical, some personal. While we do understand that genuine medical issues can arise, the majority of excuses we’ve received have been found to be false or exaggerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "👉 Effective immediately, any discussion regarding attendance will only happen in the presence of your parents—your mother or father—in the college office.\n",

      "Yes, we know some of you come from far-off places—Bihar, Jharkhand, etc. But even that is a one-night journey. You’ve already had 7–8 days. If you're serious about your education, your parents will make the effort.\n",

      "\n",
      "Internal assessments\n",

      "Eligibility for placement opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall personal and professional development\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we’ve heard every excuse—weddings, accidents, heatstroke, short semesters, and more. But how many of them are really genuine?\n",
      "\n",
      "Some students even fall into unhealthy distractions—smoking, drinking, relationships, and wasting time. Let’s be honest—you’re not fooling us, you're fooling yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In top institutions, students with less than 75% attendance are debarred without exception. Now, some of you say, “Other colleges in Greater Noida don’t care about attendance—they only care about fees.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That may be true—but ask yourself: what do they offer in return?\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re not here to just collect fees. We're here to deliver quality education. Yes, we accept students who may not have had the highest 12th-grade scores, but many of you asked during admission about placements, top packages, and your future. So ask yourself: Where do you stand today?\n",

      "Let me remind you—I was once a student here too. I worked hard and succeeded. Our alumni, whose posters you see on the college walls, are now earning ₹70 lakh+ per year. That didn’t happen because of excuses—it happened because of discipline and dedication.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m still giving my full effort—for your placements, internships, training, coding sessions, and extracurricular activities. But I cannot keep chasing defaulters. It drains energy meant for students who are serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s even more painful is that many students with the worst attendance live nearby—in PGs or even in the hostel. Instead of studying, some of you are partying, taking alcohols,  cigarettes, relationship , living in rooms in alpha, beta sector and wasting time—while your parents are working hard to support your future.\n",
      "18/06/25, 17:19 - Keshav Kcc: 🚨 Unacceptable Behavior\n",
      "Even more disappointing—some students are now mocking college rules, sharing official communications on social media, forming fake protest groups, and spreading negativity via WhatsApp, Instagram, or reels.\n",

Let me clarify—it is not a fine, it is security money.\n",

      "It’s actually very easy for any college to detain students who have less than 75% attendance.\n",
      "Once you're detained, neither you nor your parents can do anything. It’s a University rule, not a personal decision.\n",

      "1. Admission to Top Post-Grad Programs\n",
      "With a good GATE score, you can get into prestigious institutes (IITs, NITs, IISc, IIITs, etc.) for M.Tech / M.E / MS / PhD in Computer Science or allied areas (AI, ML, Data Science, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Stipend / Financial Support\n",
      "Postgrad programs via GATE often come with stipends (for example ~₹12,400/month in many institutes) which reduces financial burden. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. PSU Recruitment\n",
      "Many Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) use GATE scores to shortlist candidates. These jobs often have good pay, job security, and benefits. For CSE students, PSUs can mean roles in software/IT arms or technical departments. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Research Opportunities\n",
      "If you're interested in research, a good GATE score helps you access Junior Research Fellowships (JRF), SRF, PhD positions, perhaps even in national labs like ISRO, DRDO, or CSIR. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Higher Career Growth & Specialization\n",
      "Doing M.Tech/MS/PhD helps you specialize in advanced topics (AI, machine learning, security, etc.), which are increasingly valued in industry. That gives you an edge for roles needing deep technical knowledge. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Better Resume Value / Credibility\n",
      "Clearing GATE with good score shows strong fundamentals and discipline. This helps whether you go for placements, or for research, or in private / tech companies. It gives credibility. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Opportunities Across Disciplines\n",
      "Even if you want to branch into interdisciplinary or new areas (AI, robotics, data science, etc.), GATE gives access to programs that span multiple fields. As CS is very connected, having strong fundamentals via GATE helps move into newer topics. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Global / Abroad Opportunities\n",
      "Some foreign universities accept GATE scores or consider them as part of their admission / evaluation. With good credentials, going abroad becomes more viable. \n",
